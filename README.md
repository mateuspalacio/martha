To run the app you need to use

`ionic cordova run android`

for this you must do the follow first

`npm install -g @ionic/cli`

`npm install`

You must also install cordova, Android Studio, Gradle, Java JDK 8. Not my fault, these are requirements of cordova, which is the place that gives us the speech to text library
